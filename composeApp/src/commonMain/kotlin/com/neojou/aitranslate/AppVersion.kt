 * headline, About, and the macOS application menu all read it.
 * `./configure.sh proj_name` rewrites the literal on that line.
 * See docs/programming/How-To-Change_Project_Name.md.

 * this value. The Gradle project version reads `app.version` in gradle.properties.
 * `./configure.sh version` rewrites both.
